## ðŸ’¾ SW Side
When it comes to printing 3D designs, you will need a slicer. I'm using [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/), and for designs, well that's a whole thing of it's own.

You can find a lot of designs ready to print on a whole lot of websites, to name a few:
- [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/)
- ???
- idk i mainly use thingieverse

If you can't find a suitable design, you can make your own with one of the many readily available CAD softwares. Among the ones I tried, these would be my notable mentions:
- [**OpenSCAD**](https://openscad.org/): Hands down my absolute favorite (as of now) for creating parametric designs!
- [**TinkerCAD**](https://www.tinkercad.com/): Used a few times, but mainly when it comes to combining different STL's.
- **Slic3r**: Good tool for splitting large models that don't fit on your build plate, albeit might be outdated.
- **Fusion360**/**FreeCAD**: Not really my cup of tea, way too many options and buttons, OpenSCAD had a much quicker learning curve. Fusion is kinda messy with the whole "cloud only" saves deal, and FreeCAD seems to bug out every now and then. I haven't used em that much other than a few kitchen tools but maybe one day!

## ðŸ›  HW Equipment
Ender 3v2 ðŸ–¨ with the following upgrades:
- BL Touch probe
- Metalic extruder
- Most likely something else I don't recall, been a while since I got this


Upgrades I should have but I probably won't, as may be worth/cheaper upgrading to something better and faster:
- Ferrules on screw terminals
- SD2microsd
- Dual Z axis motors


Quality of life tools:
  - Digital Calipers
  - Electric stove top scraping blade - best tool to clean my glass bed


My G-Code setup using Marlin on the mobo:
