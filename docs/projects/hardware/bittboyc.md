# Type-C charging port swap for the bittboy pocket go

Out of all the SBC handhelds I tried, the Pocket Go holds a special place in my heart. There's just something about the size, and for some reason, I have to yet find a handheld more comfy for playing PC Engine's R-Type than this one!

My issue was since it was somewhat an older console, it had a micro usb charging port, and I wanted to get rid of it and replace it with type c.

I used my hotplate to remove the old port, and then I started soldering the new one. Only issue was, when all was set and done, and epoxy applyed, it occured to me I had placed the new port in a way which didn't allow for the backplate to be re-assembled. After some elbow grease and a few broken pads (luckily data ones which I didn't need), I managed to put it all back together, and I ended up with a functional type c charging port!

If I can find some pictures I will add em as I no longer have that phone.
