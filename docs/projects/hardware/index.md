# Hardware projects
## Excuse the terrible soldering jobs!

ðŸ›  Toolbox:
- Pinecil V2 - 65W PD compliant soldering iron with custom OS
- Hotplate - 65W PD compliant tiny hotplate
- Multimeter 
- One too many sets of screwdrivers with 10 bajilion bits because I keep finding interesting ones and I just can't help it
