# 👋 Howdy!

## I'm [**Smoothini**](https://github.com/Smoothini) and here I share:

<!--
- 🧠 [Software projects](software)
- 🔧 [Hardware projects](hardware)
- 📐 [CAD designs](cad)
- 📝 [Blog posts](blog)
- 🛠️ [Other tools, utilities, and experiments](tech.md)
-->


### [🧠 Software](projects/software/)
Tools, apps, scripts, and code experiments - mostly written in Python, bash, .NET or whatever weird thing I was onto at the time.

### [🔧 Hardware](projects/hardware/)
Electronics, embedded stuff, Pi/Arduino-based builds, and hacky repairs. High emphasis on hacky!!

### [📐 CAD Designs](projects/cad/)
Parametric designs I made, almost all of them in [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/). I don't know, there's just something about writing code to generate 3D models.

### [📝 Blog](/blog/)
Tech logs, thoughts, how-tos, and whatever I feel like writing about. Maybe also insights on projects I didn't directly contribute to.

### [🛠️ Other](/other/)
Things that don’t fit elsewhere - calculators, notes, and utilities.
