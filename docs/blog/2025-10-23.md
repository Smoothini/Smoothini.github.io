**Situation**

Finally found an obsidian plugin for navigating dates, and opening daily notes in advance <small>yay</small>

**Problema**

While its nice and all, I kinda have a thing for knowing how many days in the past or future a day is. After some digging, found out obsidian plugins are basically made with typescript, and since I'm not that versed in ts, especially when it comes to the whole part of async and moving data back and forth, I am very pleased that I managed to pull off all my requirements:

![Solution #1](/assets/images/blog/2025_10_23-3.png)
![Solution #2](/assets/images/blog/2025_10_23-4.png)

  - [X] added a red negative counter for days in the past
  - [X] added a green counter for days in the future
  - [X] marked today with 0
  - [X] marked today with 0ðŸŒ› in case its between midnight and 4AM (I got mini heart attacks way too often when checking the clock past midnight and realize the calendar changed, I can't be the only one.....)
  - [X] added option in settings to toggle on/off

Made a fork and all that, now just gotta wait till it gets approved, else I may take the project in another direction, and give it more quality of life features <small>such as a danish mode to display week numbers.</small>

Thank you for reading ðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘‰
